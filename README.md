### Contribution plan:
Since this is being done by multiple people, it is best practice to learn how git/github works with its branches, for this project we will be using a

```
project ---o---> addition1 ---o---> beta_addition1
            \
             \--> addition2 ---o---> beta_addition2

```

Where each of the additions that we want to make will first be tested in a beta branch, then check to make sure it fits with the current project by using the addition branch, and if it works, we can merge it to the project branch which is tested and working code. This makes it easier to work on stuff seperately and makes it easier to understand who is working on what.
